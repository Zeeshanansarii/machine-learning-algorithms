Machine Learning Pipeline: From Scratch to Production

1. Data Collection
   - Gather raw data from various sources (databases, APIs, files, web scraping).

2. Data Cleaning
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct errors, filter outliers.

3. Data Preprocessing
   - Encode categorical variables, feature engineering, text/vector transformations.

4. Data Scaling
   - Normalize or standardize features for model compatibility.

5. Model Building
   - Select algorithm, split data, train model, tune hyperparameters.

6. Model Evaluation
   - Assess performance using metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, etc.), cross-validation.

7. Model Serialization
   - Save trained model (pickle, joblib, framework-specific methods).

8. Deployment Preparation
   - Create API (Flask, FastAPI), containerize (Docker), prepare inference scripts.

9. Production Deployment
   - Deploy to cloud/on-prem server, set up endpoints for predictions.

10. Monitoring & Maintenance
   - Monitor performance, retrain as needed, log predictions, handle data drift.
