Machine Learning Pipeline: From Scratch to Production

1. Data Collection
   - Gather raw data from various sources (databases, APIs, files, web scraping).

2. Data Cleaning
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct errors, filter outliers.

3. Data Preprocessing
   - Encode categorical variables, feature engineering, text/vector transformations.

4. Data Scaling
   - Normalize or standardize features for model compatibility.

5. Model Building
   - Select algorithm, split data, train model, tune hyperparameters.

6. Model Evaluation
   - Assess performance using metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, etc.), cross-validation.

7. Model Serialization
   - Save trained model (pickle, joblib, framework-specific methods).

8. Deployment Preparation
   - Create API (Flask, FastAPI), containerize (Docker), prepare inference scripts.

9. Production Deployment
   - Deploy to cloud/on-prem server, set up endpoints for predictions.

10. Monitoring & Maintenance
   - Monitor performance, retrain as needed, log predictions, handle data drift.


# the dataset must not have multi collinear

# VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) is a number that tells you if a feature (column) in your data is too similar to other features.
# If VIF is high (usually above 5 or 10), it means that feature is highly related to others, which can confuse your model.
# To use VIF:
# 1. Calculate VIF for each feature.
# 2. If a feature has a high VIF, consider removing it to make your model better.
# Example (Python):
# from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
# import pandas as pd
# vif_data = pd.DataFrame()
# vif_data["feature"] = X.columns
# vif_data["VIF"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
# print(vif_data)

VIF is a number that tells you if a feature (column) in your data is too similar to other features.
If VIF is high (usually above 5 or 10), it means that feature is highly related to others, which can confuse your model.
To use VIF: calculate it for each feature, and if a feature has a high VIF, consider removing it to improve your model.
